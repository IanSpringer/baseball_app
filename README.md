##Approach
This project was one of the hardest I've done, but I think I learned the most out of it. I wanted to build something that was simple, clean, and easy to use. Since baseball is a love of mine, I wanted to create something where users could look up their favorite stadiums and find info about them. I started off by building out my own stadium api which I was able to render into individual show pages using a dynamic route that all pulled from the api. Then, I tackled login, register, and logout with Passport Local Strategy. 

##Unsolved Problems
* Delete button functionality only works when you refresh the page.
* There's a weird bug when you refresh the Bucket List page where it prints out duplicates, but doesn't happen when you navigate away and come back.
* I would like to style the image of the index page to be darker without affecting the text.
